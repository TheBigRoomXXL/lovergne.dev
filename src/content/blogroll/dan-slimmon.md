A blog that distills years of experience in incident response. As I work in a 
young startup, there are very few procedures and methodologies in place to 
handle incidents, and this blog has been a very good source of inspiration to 
improve our standards. I especially encourage you to read about 
[clinical troubleshooting](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2024/03/08/clinical-troubleshooting-diagnose-any-production-issue-fast/), 
which is disproportionately effective given its simplicity.
