This site is just a fantastic example of web design: it's fast, aesthetically 
pleasing, and fully accessible. It features a lot of charming CSS animations 
while not moving the page too much. It has a real personal touch, especially 
with its procedural 'pixel banner' at the top and bottom of the page while not 
being gimmicky.

On this blog, you will find a lot of good guides for CSS and Svelte, as well 
as various things about frontend and development in general.
