title: The Rise of Worse is Better
author: R. P. Gabriel
description: This article discusses the trade-off between implementation
  simplicity and interface simplicity and argues in favor of implementation
  simplicity. Despite being published more than 30 years ago it is still
  interesting and relevant. If you find it interesting you can also read the
  counter argument <cite>"Worse is Better is Worse"</cite> by Nickieben Bourbaki
  (it's the same author under a pseudonym).
