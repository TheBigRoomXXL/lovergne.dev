CSS Bed is a collection of classless CSS theme, it let you test
each of them by effortlessly changing the stylesheet of the site. I am a big
fan of classless CSS for small and static website (like this one), it reduce
unnecessary complexity by not having to think about class at all and only
concentrate on semantic HTML. Also modern framework provide CSS isolation wich
mean class are not as much of a necessity to avoid colision between components.
