title: The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work
author: P. Rogaway
description: "In reaction to the Snowden's revelation in 2013, Phillip Rogaway started to reconsider
  his role and social responsibility as a cryptographer. This paper focus on the discipline of
  cryptography but the first part does an excellent job at explaining why <b>any</b> technician has
  a social impact, whether that's on purpose or not, and therefore should be conscious of his 
  political responsibility."
