title: Schemathesis
description: Schemathesis is an incredible fuzzer for REST and GraphQL API. It
  can be used through   CLI or integrate directly with your unit test in python.
  Thanks to it's property-based testing, I have found numerous bug, including
  inside my dependencies, . It also help me catch bad documentation with it's
  response schema validation. I definitly integrate it inside my CI/CD pipeline
  whenever I can. <br>
  If you have been impressed by schemathesis capability like me and you want to
  know more about it's conception I would recommend reading the paper published
  by its creators <cite>"Deriving Semantics-Aware Fuzzers from Web API Schemas"
  </cite> by Zac Hatfield-Dodds and Dmitry Dygalo.
