title: Schemathesis
description: "Schemathesis is an incredible fuzzer for REST and GraphQL API. It
  can be used through   CLI or integrate directly with your unit test in python.
  Thanks to it's property-based testing, I have found numerous bug, including
  inside my dependencies, . It also help me catch bad documentation with it's
  response schema validation. I definitly integrate it inside my CI/CD pipeline
  whenever I can."
