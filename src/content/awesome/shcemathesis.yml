description: "Schemathesis is an incredible fuzzer for REST and GraphQL API. It can be used through \
  CLI or integrate directly with your unit test in python. I have found numerous bug, including \
  inside my dependencies, thanks to it's property-based testing. It also help catch bad documentation \
  with it's response schema validation. I definitly integrate it inside my CI/CD pipeline whenever I can."
