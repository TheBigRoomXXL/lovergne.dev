title: "RFC9457: Problem Details for HTTP APIs"
added_date: 2023-08-21

There are currently no standard ways for API to communicate there
domain specific error where HTTP status is not enough. This RFC hopes to remedy
that with a proposed schema for error response. I think it's a good proposal,
it give enough feedback and it's flexibility enough to work in most API. The
one thing I really like is that it forces you to document your API's specific
errors because a link to documentation about the error is included in the
schema.
