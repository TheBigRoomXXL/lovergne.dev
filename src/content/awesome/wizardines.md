A series of vulgarisation comics on all sorts of topics related to programming. 
I think it's an excellent ressource for beginner programmers, it lets you ask 
some questions about basic things that you usually don't have time for or maybe don't
afraid to ask, like: [what is http?](https://wizardzines.com/zines/http/)
or [what is memory allocation?](https://wizardzines.com/comics/memory-allocation/)
