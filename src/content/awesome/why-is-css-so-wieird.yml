title: Why is CSS so Weird?
description: '
  Because the web has been build with a set of value at it''s core
  : <strong> the web is open, it''s for everyone and everything</strong>. By
  accepting those value we must, at the same time, accept that we loose some
  degree of control, we don''t choose who will look at our website and on what
  devices. That lake of control means we must build websites for an infinite
  canvas with unknown constraints and capabilities. But designing for the
  unknown is hard, for that, we need flexibility, and this is where CSS come in.
  </p><p>
  The <b>Cascade</b> in Cascading Style Sheets is the process of assembling
  styles from different inputs. You gain from that process the capability
  to merge <b>intent</b> from different sources: the Author, the Browser and
  remarkably, the User.
  </p>
  <img
  alt="Author Browser and User consolidate into one style throught cascade"
  src=/cascade.svg
  style="max-width:80%; max-height:200px;"
  />
  <p>
  It also allows us to fail gracefully by cascading upward wich is good for
  resilence and backward compatibility.
  But the tradeoff is that your instructions can be overridden, they became
  suggestions. This is one of the pitfalls of CCS and why we sometime have to use
  the infamous <code>!important</code>. The other consequence is that
  everything is hierarchically linked. This is great, as one style can be reused
  in many similar places to achieve consistency, but this is also another big
  pitfall of CSS as a style might impact elements it was never meant to.
  </p><p>
  Overall some might think that we made a bad tradeoff with CSS by loosing too
  much control, but I don''t think so. As John Allsopp said, <cite>"Control[...]
  is a limitation of the printed page"</cite>,  when a book is produce and sold
  only the editor can make it accessible, and he fails to do it most of the time
  whether it''s diagrams with bad contrast or the absence of braille editions
  or other things. But with the browser and CSS  the user has the last word,
  he can make it feet it''s need, whatever it is.'
