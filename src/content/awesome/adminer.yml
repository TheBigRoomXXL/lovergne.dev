title: Adminer
description: Minimalist, fast, single-file, UI for RDBMS. <b>phpMyAdmin but way better</b>. I love 
  there interface, it's very clear and readable. Adminer is simple but also fully featured. It is 
  customizable and extendable throught themes and plugins. It also integrate very well with docker
  and help access the database for debugging. Overall a very practical tool to have in the toolbox.
