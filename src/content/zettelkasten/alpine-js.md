Make the web simple again! Alpine.js provide DOM reactivity and
two-way data binding thought a lightweight framework. It's build on top of
the `@vue/reactivity` package, which is it's only dependency, and the whole
framework is ~16kb minified and compressed. Alpine.js work very well on it's
owm but I think it would be very interesting to see if it synergize well with
HTMX for the place where client site reactivity is absolutly needed.
