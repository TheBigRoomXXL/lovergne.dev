An excellent **performance-Aware programming** course by Casey Muratori. If you're not
familiar with him, Casey Muratori is a programmer who specializes in game engine research
and development. He has extensive knowledge of CPU and GPU micro-architecture and how they
interact with software performance.

This course is designed for programmers who already know how to code but want to learn how
to maximize hardware performance. The course is language-agnostic, focusing on five
optimizations applicable to any program: waste reduction, instructions per clock, single
operation, multiple data (SIMD), caching, and multi-threading.

The course is updated weekly with a Q&A for the previous week, a new lesson, and homework
assignments for the upcoming week. It is not free; it costs $9 per month. I recommend
checking out some of the free episodes available on his [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@mollyrocket?si=HEWDx_HjvBjrD3uK)
or one of his [interviews](https://youtu.be/Zr09I5OlOjs?si=oM1tmYGWNE6EGaxX) first to see
if the course is right for you.
