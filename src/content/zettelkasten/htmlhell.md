I considered myself pretty up to date with the functionality offered by HTML 
but HTMLHell show me I was wrong. Notably I discovered the existence of 
[download links](https://www.htmhell.dev/tips/download-links/) (how did I miss 
that all this time?!) and [how to use \<picture\> for progressive enhancement](https://www.htmhell.dev/tips/the-avif-image-format/).


The site has two main section:

1. **Hell:** where you find bad, but not obviously bad, examples of HTML code
2. **Heaven:** where you discover little-known but very useful features of HTML


There is also an advent calendar with tips and tricks in December. I highly 
recommend exploring this site if you want to deepen your understanding of what 
HTML has to offer.
