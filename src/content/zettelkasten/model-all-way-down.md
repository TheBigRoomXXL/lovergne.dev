"Models All the Way Down" by [Knowing Machines](https://knowingmachines.org/about) is a detailed investigation
into the datasets behind our current foundational AI models, the methods used to create
them, and the inevitable biases they produce. The results of this investigation are
presented through a stunning visual display based on the collected data. The storytelling
is excellent, allowing readers to understand the subject progressively, even if they are
novices. 

All the data from their investigation has been published on [GitHub](https://github.com/NYUEngelberg/models-all-the-way).
