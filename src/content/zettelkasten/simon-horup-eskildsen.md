A lot o very advance discucions on scaling relational database. Most of it I will
probably never need to apply but none the less interesting. I recommand reading
[Careful Trading Complexity for 'Improvements'](https://sirupsen.com/trading-complexity)
about the *perceived* trade-off of complexity for scalability and reliability.
I also realy liked [When To Write a Simulator](https://sirupsen.com/napkin/problem-16-simulation)
wich made me realise that I was building a load balancer based on probably false
assumption because instincts suck when it come to statistics.
