A great blog about low-level and embedded programming. The author works at 
[0xyde](https://oxide.computer/) and is one of the creators of 
[Hubris](https://cliffle.com/blog/on-hubris-and-humility/), 
an OS designed for *"32-bit microcontrollers with region-based memory protection 
and kiB to MiB of RAM and Flash"*. I really like the detailed blog posts about Hubris
and it always makes me want to try my hand at an embedded system, it's not on my
roadmap yet, but one day it will be!
