In reaction to the Snowden's revelation in 2013, Phillip Rogaway
started to reconsider his role and social responsibility as a cryptographer.
This paper focus on the discipline of  cryptography but the first part does an
excellent job at explaining why **any** technician has a social impact,
whether that's on purpose or not, and therefore should be conscious of his
political responsibility.
