What I like about this blog are the "down the rabbit hole" and "neet peaky" articles, like
[Hardest Problem in Computer Science: Centering Things](https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/)
and  [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Must Know About Unicode in 2023 (Still No Excuses!)](https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/).
