I discovered programming when I first tried to make games using RPG Maker XP. I was 12 or 13 years old and was amazed by the possibility of creating my own world and story. I quickly moved on to Game Maker and then Godot. Along the way, I started many projects and even finished and published four of them!

Two of these games, Harpoon and Defend Your Pink Planet, were created in just 48 hours during game jams. It's liberating to know that everything must be done  in 48h and that you can cut corners and make a lot of mistakes. It's a great way to learn and to have fun.

I’m especially proud of Harpoon because players experienced it exactly as I had envisioned. I’m also proud of Gravity²—it was my first game, and my friends and I had an amazing time playing it.
