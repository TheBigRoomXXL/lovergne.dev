Restic is the tool you **should** use for your backups. 
- You can always find what you need in a restic backup because it uses incremental snapshots (like git).
- It's safe, because your data is always encrypted.
- It's painless, because it always checks your files for integrity and consistency.
- It's efficient, because it not only uses incremental snapshots, but also compresses them. 
- It's flexible, because it can integrate with virtually any remote storage backend (I personally use Backblaze B2).
- It's long-lastings, because the Restic repository format has its own open specification and other multiple implementations.
- It's easy to set up and maintain, because it has a good CLI interface and good documentation. 
- It's fast and CPU efficient, because it's in Golang.

Restic, what else?
