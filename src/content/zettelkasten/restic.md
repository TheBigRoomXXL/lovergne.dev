Restic is the tool you **should** be using for your backups: 
1. You can always find what you need in a restic backup because it uses incremental snapshots (like git).
2. It's safe, because your data is always encrypted.
3. It's painless, because it always checks your files for integrity and consistency.
4. It's efficient, because it not only uses incremental snapshots, but also compresses them. 
5. It's flexible, because it can integrate with virtually any remote storage backend (I personally use Backblaze B2).
6. It's long-lastings, because the Restic repository format has its own open specification and other multiple implementations.
7. It's easy to set up and maintain, because it has a good CLI interface and good documentation. 
8. It's fast and CPU efficient, because it's in Golang.

Restic, what else?
