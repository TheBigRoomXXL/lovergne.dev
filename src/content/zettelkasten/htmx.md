Make the web simple again! HTMX is a framework for building frontend with the
hypermedia design philosophy. It's dependency free and weight only ~14k
minified and compressed wich is really nice. It's not for every project, for
example if you want offline support it's not what you should use, but it can
be used in way more applications than people realize, especially CRUDish apps
or data exploration apps.
