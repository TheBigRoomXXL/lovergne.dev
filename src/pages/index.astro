	<h2>Hello World!</h2>
	<p>
		Welcome! My name is Sebastien Lovergne. I'm an inveterate tinkerer and I work as a
		software engineer.
	<p/>
	<p>
		This website is a place where I can experiment and be creative. I mostly publish links to
		external resources that I have found interesting or thought-provoking (or some 
		<a href="https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd">fun stuff</a>), think of it as my personal
		web library. I also write about some of my personal projects, but this is rarer.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/TheBigRoomXXL">github</a>,
		<a href="https://tehbigroomxxl.itch.io/">itch.io</a>
		or contacts me by mail at <a href="mailto:sebastien@lovergne.dev">sebastien@lovergne.dev</a>.
