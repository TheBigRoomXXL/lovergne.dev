## Personal Projects

### OpenTelemetry instrumentation for Marshmallow (WIP)

[Project repository](https://github.com/TheBigRoomXXL/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/instrument-marshmallow)  

[Marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is one of python most popular
library when it comes to deserialization, validation and serialization. As such it is an
important part of the workflow in many web framework.

This project aim at providing observability for those workflow with OpenTelemetry tracing
(no metric planned for now). If this project is successful it will be published to the
[OpenTelemetry Python Contribution](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib)

### Game Development

I have currently **4 published games**. check them out on [itch.io](https://tehbigroomxxl.itch.io/)

Game dev is how I descovered programing. For me, game creation is about creativity and experimentation. I have worked with many differente engine: RPG Maker, Game maker studio, Unity, Processing and most recently Godot. I do everything myself except music: game and level design, code, graphics, animation, sound effect.
