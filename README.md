# My Personal website

Check it out at [lovergne.dev](lovergne.dev)

This website is a place where I can experiment and be creative. I mostly publish links to
external resources that I have found interesting or thought-provoking (and some fun stuff), think
of it as my personal web library. I also write about some of my personal projects, but this is rarer.

The source code is mainly HTML and CSS with juste a littl bit of javascript sprikle in. 
Then I use Astro for static site generation and there is no other dependencie ( well technically there
is [normalize.css](https://csstools.github.io/normalize.css/11.0.0/normalize.css) but it's so small
it doesn't count!).

Ands it's blazingly fast and accessible!
